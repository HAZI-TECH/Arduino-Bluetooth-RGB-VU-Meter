DIY Bluetooth RGB VU Meter | Multi Color with Patterns
==============

Introduction
----
Here I present you a Bluetooth Stereo VU Meter with Pattern, Color, Brightness and Audio sensitivity control options. It is required to make the VU Meter Control Box as shown in the below linked video to start this project. If you already have it, it is a $2 mod. And now you have the option to connect your phone / laptop with speakers wirelessly. Enjoy!.

UPDATE - Use the "VHM-314 Bluetooth 5.0 Audio Receiver Module" for higher quality, lossless decoding instead of using the CA-6928 module. Wiring stays the same for both modules.
